<h6>Event Description</h6>
<p>Calling all young people! Macedonia SDA Church is thrilled to invite you to our highly anticipated annual Youth Retreat, "Awaken," taking place on September 14, 2023, at Olodo Primary School. This weekend getaway promises to be a life-changing experience filled with engaging workshops, powerful worship sessions, and fun activities that will inspire and equip our youth to navigate the challenges of life while deepening their relationship with God.</p>
<p>At "Awaken: Youth Retreat 2023," our mission is to ignite the faith of our youth and empower them on their spiritual journey. Through a carefully curated program, we will provide an atmosphere of growth, connection, and transformation.</p>
<p> Engaging Workshops:
Our retreat will feature a wide range of interactive workshops led by experienced speakers and mentors. These workshops will cover topics that are relevant to the youth's lives, such as identity, purpose, faith in the modern world, overcoming obstacles, and finding strength in adversity. Through these sessions, our young participants will gain valuable insights and practical tools to navigate the challenges they face and emerge stronger in their faith.</p>
<p> Powerful Worship Sessions:
Prepare to be moved and inspired during our powerful worship sessions. Led by talented solos, passionate singers, and dynamic speakers, these sessions will create an atmosphere where the youth can freely express their love for God. Through heartfelt prayers, soul-stirring music, and inspiring sermons, we aim to deepen their connection with God and awaken a renewed sense of purpose and devotion.</p>
<p> Fun Activities:
In addition to the enriching workshops and worship sessions, we have planned a variety of fun and memorable activities to foster camaraderie and create lasting friendships. From team-building exercises to outdoor adventures, sports competitions, and talent showcases, our retreat will provide a space for the youth to relax, have fun, and build strong bonds with fellow believers.</p>
<p> As we embark on this transformative journey, we are guided by the following Bible verses:</p>
<p> 1. "But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light." - 1 Peter 2:9</p>
<P>2. "Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity." - 1 Timothy 4:12</P>
<P>3. "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight." - Proverbs 3:5-6</P>
<P>Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity to awaken your faith, empower your journey, and forge lifelong connections. Join us at "Awaken: Youth Retreat 2023" and experience a weekend filled with inspiration, growth, and transformation.</P>

<p class="rev-info">“ I had the pleasure of attending this incredible event and I can't rave enough about it. From start to finish, it was an absolute delight. The organizers put together a seamless experience, with every detail carefully planned and executed. The atmosphere was electric, filled with excitement and positive energy. The variety of activities and performances kept everyone engaged and entertained throughout the event. The food and drinks were top-notch, and the venue was stunning. But what truly made the event exceptional was the sense of community and connection that was fostered among attendees. It was a truly memorable experience that left me feeling inspired and grateful.. “</p>
